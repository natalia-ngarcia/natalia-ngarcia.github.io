<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Florida Gator. Story enthusiast. Music blogger. Disney Nerd. Bookworm. Food / film / televison connoisseur.
</p>
    
<p>
I like to describe myself in a number of different ways for my many passions and interests.<br>

    At four years old, I was reading books on my own and haven't stopped since. In high school, my love for storytelling led to me to the yearbook staff. That same passion followed me through college where I now study journalism at the University of Florida. I am currently a junior, with a concentration in magazine editing and a minor in business administration.<br>
    
    When my nose isn't buried in a book, I can be found front row at a concert. Music has always been apart of my life and put that energy into the music blog I write for called Mind Equals Blown.<br>

    Born and raised in Orlando, Florida, I would say that the theme park industry has played a huge part in my life. My family has had annual passes to every park since I was old enough to need one.<br>

    Although I'm not certain to where the future will take me, I know that it will be bright.
