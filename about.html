<h1>About Me</h1>
        
    <p>
    My name is Natalia Nicollett Garcia. Along with being a student at the University of Florida, I consider myself an aspiring writer and multimedia journalist.</br>
    Growing up an only child, I found myself buried in my own imagination. I always carried around notebooks and kept diaries to document my daily blurbs and create my own short stories.<br>
    At four years old, I was reading books on my own. During elementary and middle school I won several awards in essay and speech contests. When I entered high school, I used my love for writing to push me through the most rigorous classes and found my niche in the yearbook staff where I served as writer and editor for three years. The same passion that I grew up with as a child, followed me through college where I now study the art of storytelling.<br>
    Currently, I am working on obtaining my bachelor of science in journalism, with a minor in business administration. My days are spent balancing two campus jobs, a full-time curriculum and submitting stories to local newspapers and online news outlets. My nights are spent blogging about the latest music releases and reviewing the newest movies.<br>
    On lazy days I watch House Hunters and Four Weddings marathons. My Netflix queue is filled with dramatic and comedic telivision shows, including the Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, The Office and Arrested Development. My iTunes holds over 10,000 songs from Fall Out Boy, The Wonder Years, Taylor Swift and Neil Diamond. Concerts, theme parks, event planning and collecting Star Wars memorabilia are a few of my favorite hobbies.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
       I am a little bit of everything and some things in between.
